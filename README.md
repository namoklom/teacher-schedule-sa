This project implements a weekly teacher scheduling system using the **Simulated Annealing** (SA) algorithm. It ensures that each teacher receives at least one teaching slot, with a maximum of 12 shifts per week, and adheres to various scheduling constraints.

**Simulated Annealing (SA)** is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the physical process of annealing in metallurgy, where metals are heated and then slowly cooled to remove defects and reach a more stable, low-energy state.

## üìÖ Constraints and Cost Formulas in Teacher Scheduling

### Let:

### 1. Break Shift Must Be Empty

### 2. No Teacher Teaches More Than One Shift per Day

### 3. Maximum Number of Shifts per Teacher per Week (12 shifts)

### 4. Every Teacher Must Teach at Least One Shift per Week

## üìà How It Works Together

- The SA algorithm starts with a random schedule.  
- It calculates the total cost based on the above formula.  
- It generates neighbor schedules by changing teacher assignments randomly.  
- Moves that reduce cost are accepted.  
- Moves that increase cost might be accepted based on probability related to temperature.  
- Temperature gradually decreases to reduce acceptance of worse solutions over time.  
- After iterations, the best found schedule minimizes the total cost and respects constraints as much as possible.

    <td style="width:80%; vertical-align: top;">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The final schedule is visualized as a heatmap, where:

- Rows represent shifts (time slots).
- Columns represent days of the week.
- Each cell shows the initials of the assigned teacher and their subject.
- Empty or break shifts are left blank.
- A color-coded legend matches teachers with their subjects for easy identification.

This visualization helps quickly identify teacher workloads, shift distribution, and adherence to constraints.
