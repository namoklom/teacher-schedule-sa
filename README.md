This project implements a weekly teacher scheduling system for 45 teachers using the **Simulated Annealing (SA)** algorithm. . The schedule spans 6 days per week and 9 time shifts per day, with one slot reserved exclusively for breaks. It ensures that each teacher receives at least one teaching slot, with a maximum of 12 shifts per week, and adheres to various scheduling constraints.

**Simulated Annealing (SA)** is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the physical process of annealing in metallurgy, where metals are heated and then slowly cooled to remove defects and reach a more stable, low-energy state.

### 2. No Teacher Teaches More Than One Shift per Day

### 4. Every Teacher Must Teach at Least One Shift per Week

## üìà How It Works Together

- The SA algorithm starts with a random schedule.  
- It calculates the total cost based on the above formula.  
- It generates neighbor schedules by changing teacher assignments randomly.  
- Moves that reduce cost are accepted.  
- Moves that increase cost might be accepted based on probability related to temperature.  
- Temperature gradually decreases to reduce acceptance of worse solutions over time.  
- After iterations, the best found schedule minimizes the total cost and respects constraints as much as possible.

  </tr>

The final schedule is visualized as a heatmap, where:

- Rows represent shifts (time slots).
- Columns represent days of the week.
- Each cell shows the initials of the assigned teacher and their subject.
- Empty or break shifts are left blank.
- A color-coded legend matches teachers with their subjects for easy identification.

The purpose of this heatmap is to provide a clear and intuitive visualization of the optimized weekly teaching schedule. It helps stakeholders‚Äîsuch as administrators or planners‚Äîquickly understand when and where each teacher is assigned, ensure that scheduling constraints (like maximum shifts, no double-booking, and break periods) are met, and identify any potential issues or imbalances in the distribution of teaching duties.
