# Teacher Scheduling Optimization using Simulated Annealing

This project implements a weekly teacher scheduling system using the **Simulated Annealing** (SA) algorithm. It ensures that each teacher receives at least one teaching slot, with a maximum of 12 shifts per week, and adheres to various scheduling constraints.

**Simulated Annealing (SA)** is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the physical process of annealing in metallurgy, where metals are heated and then slowly cooled to remove defects and reach a more stable, low-energy state.
